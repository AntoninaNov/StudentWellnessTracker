# Student Wellness Tracker

## General Description
Student well-being is crucial for their success and happiness. Schools are more than places for learning facts; they are environments where students grow and develop as individuals. In today‚Äôs fast-paced world, students face numerous challenges that can impact their mental and physical health. Addressing these challenges proactively is essential for improving academic performance, social interactions, and overall health.

The Student Wellness Tracker is designed to help students manage their health and well-being. This app includes features like mental health check-ins, logging physical activities and nutrition, sleep tracking, social and emotional learning (SEL) modules, real-time support, and goal setting. These tools support students in maintaining a balanced and healthy lifestyle.
